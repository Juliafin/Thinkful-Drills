<p> this example, we've set float: left; on the .left class, and applied that class to the three image elements.
By doing so, we've taken the images out of the normal flow, and pushed them to the left. The paragraph text, which is in
the normal flow, wraps to the right of the images. We've set the right margin on the images so there's a gap between each one,
and a gap between the rightmost image and the text.

Note that if we set float: right; instead, the images would move to the right of the page, and the text would wrap on the left.
When you have more than one floated element, as we do in the example above, those elements will continue to horizontally
stack next to one another, as long as there is space in the parent container. If there's not enough space, they'll go on to
the next line (if you want to see this behavior, copy and paste the image element a couple more times in the Codepen above).

For some layouts, you need to set the clear property in an element immediately following a floated element. Let's have a
look at a problem case where this is necessary
